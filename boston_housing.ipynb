    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "**Answer: **  Increase of RM would lead to an increase in MEDV as houses with more rooms always tend to increase in value mainly due to increase in space and size of the household.  Increase of LSTAT would lead to a decrease in MEDV as houses are judged by the neighborhood that they are in.  A rich neighborhood will have houses of higher prices while neighborhoods with poorer houses will tend to have houses of poor value.  Finally, increase of PTRATIO  will tend to lead to a decrease of MEDV as a small PTRATIO means that the neighborhood is rich enough to pay for large schools that will accomodate a small student to teacher ratio, hence the houses will have to be rich in order to finance the large schools.  Hence, a small PTRATIO will tend to lead to larger MEDV."

By this, I mean that we can measure the ability to the algorithm on how it performs on novel data that it hasn't seen before based on data it has trained with.  Also, we can see whether the data is being overfitted or underfitted by comparing the accuracies of both the training set and testing set.  When the accuracy for the training set is high for example, but is lower on the testing set, we know that it's being overtrained."

Additionally, you'll investigate one particular algorithm with an increasing `'max_depth'` parameter on the full training set to observe how model complexity affects performance. Graphing your model's performance based on varying criteria can be beneficial in the analysis process, such as visualizing behavior that may not have been apparent from the results alone."

    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "**Answer: **  At a maximum depth of 1, the validation score and the training score are both low, though almost equal to each other.  This means that the model is underfitting, which is a sign of high bias.  When it's trained with a maximum depth of 10, the training score is very high, but the testing score is much lower compared to it.  Therefore, it suffers from overfitting, which is a sign of high variance."

    "** Hint: ** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model? And remember, Occams Razor states \"Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.\""

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "**Answer: **  I would suggest that a maximum depth of 4 is the best to generalize to unseen data as it balances between bias and variance.  The area has some variance, but not too much to start causing the model to vary wildly.  It also has the highest possible accuracy rate at 0.7, with the variance not being too large so that it stays within 0.6-0.8.  These tradeoffs allow it to be the best optimal model."

It will create sets of all the combinations possible for all hyperparameters and exhaustively test each combination, keeping track of the accuracies for all combinations.  The set of parameters with the best accuracy can be used for the algorithm.  It can be used to optimize on a learning algorithm as it will iterate through a complete set of parameters, outputting the validation accuracy at each period.  "

    "**Answer: **  The k-fold cross-validation technique is where the data set is split into equally divided k sections of data.  The model is trained on k-1 sections of data and the last section is held out to test the accuracy of the model.  The model is trained k times using this technique.  The final k accuracies can be analyzed or averaged to get a better idea of the accuracy of a model.  The benefit of this technique for grid search is that it can return a ground based accuracy that gives an indication of how good of an accuracy a current set of parameters are.  By using the accuracy results from k-fold cross validation, one can find the optimum set of parameters from grid search to optimize a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's generally beneficial to use more splits for training/testing purposes as we're able to get more data for training a more complete model on the k-1 splits.  We also have more validation splits to test our trained models and hence get a better picture of the accuracy.  It is more beneficial than a simple train/test split as we can't do parameter tuning on the testing set from a simple train/test split as we don't know if the model trained on a simple train/test split represents fully the data itself; it could have biased data in having more data from one class and other imbalances that a simple split does.  With K-Fold splits, we can be sure that hyperparameter tuning based on the k-folds will be accurate as it will work with all data and not on a simple segment of data which may not represent the whole dataset."

    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that ShuffleSplit has different parameters in scikit-learn versions 0.17 and 0.18.\n",
    "For the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.\n",
    "  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.\n",
    "  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n",
    "  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) from `sklearn.grid_search` to create a grid search object.\n",
